# Individual Report: News Intelligence Analysis Based on Sentiment Analysis and Association Mining  
**Gongfan宫凡 24439169**

In this group project, I was primarily responsible for sentiment analysis and association rule mining on the HuffPost news dataset. Based on an in-depth understanding and practical implementation of these technologies, I propose the following innovative application solutions:  
### 1. Multimodal Entity-Level Sentiment Alert System  
**Innovation**: Extends traditional text sentiment analysis to a multimodal entity association network by integrating:  
**Entity sentiment polarity** (e.g., "Trump: -0.16" vs. "America: 0.04")  
**Entity co-occurrence networks** (identifying frequently co-occurring entities via association rule mining)  
**Cross-modal sentiment consistency detection** (comparing text sentiment with image/video sentiment)  
### 2. Dynamic Adaptive Association Recommendation Engine  
**Innovation**: Breaks through the limitations of static association rules by implementing a three-stage dynamic evolution:  
**Real-time association**: Standard recommendations based on current news content  
**Contextual adaptation**: Adjusts recommendation weights using real-time user sentiment feedback  
**Trend evolution**: Dynamically updates association rules through online learning mechanisms  

## Key Technical Findings  

**Composite Sentiment Analysis Framework**:  
- The hybrid scoring system integrating VADER (-0.6808), TextBlob (-0.15625), and Transformer (-0.92486) demonstrated the highest discriminative power in political news analysis.  
- Entity-level analysis revealed a significant sentiment difference between "Trump" (-0.16) and "America" (0.04) (p < 0.0001).  

**Dynamic Association Rule Discovery**:  

| Rule Pattern                     | Support | Confidence | Lift |
|----------------------------------|---------|------------|------|
| {entity=FBI} → {sentiment=negative} | 0.001   | 0.831      | 1.853 |
| {category=Politics} → {entity=Trump} | 0.012   | 0.709      | 3.142 |

**Cross-Domain Sentiment Shifts**:  
- Environmental news exhibited a higher average sentiment score (0.16) compared to political news (-0.11).  
- 12.7% of texts showed contradictory sentiment polarities between VADER and TextBlob.  

## Extended Application Prospects  
**Real-Time Public Opinion Monitoring Dashboard**:  
   - Integrates temporal analysis of entity sentiment  
   - Automatically alerts on breaking negative events (e.g., detecting "shooting" entities with sentiment values < -0.8)

**Personalized News Recommendation System**:

**Fake News Detection Module**:  
- Analyzes sentiment-entity consistency (e.g., differing sentiment for "vaccine" in scientific vs. political news)  
- Detects exaggerated expressions (discrepancies between sentiment intensity and factual statements)  

This proposal establishes an extensible innovative framework for news intelligence analysis by integrating cutting-edge sentiment analysis techniques with dynamic association mining methods. It demonstrates significant application value, particularly in real-time public opinion monitoring and personalized services.
